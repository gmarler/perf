Run test while running:

iostat -Td -xnzC 1 |
  egrep '((^Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun)|(c0$))'


Where c0 controller is being used in the case where we have multipathed SAN
storage under MPxIO control.

Make sure to run tests with and without the log device, if it's available; if
it's available, you can seperate out the log device I/O like so, where the log
device is c0t5001517BB28964A2d0 in this example:

iostat -Td -xnzC 1 |
  egrep '((^Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun)|(c0$)|(c0t5001517BB28964A2d0))'


And to calculate the average I/O size per second written out, this can be done:

iostat -Td -xnzC 1 |
 egrep '((^Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun)|(c0$))' |
 nawk 'NF==11 && $2 !~ /w\/s/{print; if ($2 > 0) {wiosz = $4 / $2; print "WRITE IO SIZE: ", wiosz;} }{print}'
