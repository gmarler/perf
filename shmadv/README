This evaluation has to do with ISM shared memory segments in Solaris spanning
more than one Locality Group when you wish them to only exist in the single
Locality Group where a single threaded process resides.

Looks like you need to use the **shmadv(2)** system call for this, so that's
what we're trying.

The methodology for testing is to force the test process (test2 at the moment)
to run in a particular Locality group via **plgrp(1)**, like so, in which we
force the process to have a "Home Locality Group" of 4 on a T5-4:
